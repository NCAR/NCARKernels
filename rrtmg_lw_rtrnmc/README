In these kernels, the results are not verified against the results file because of the number of loop
changes that change answers. The results for each of these cases have been verified against the original
code in kernel_rtrnmc.F90.v0 in a separate study.

kernel_rtrnmc.F90.v0: 
 Original version of the code

kernel_rtrnmc.F90.v1: 
 Version of code where the IPLON loop is moved inside the LEV loop

kernel_rtrnmc.F90.v2: 
 Version of code where the conditionals are moved outside of IPLON loop and 
 loop and array bounds can be defined
