CESM2 SILHS kernel extracted from CESM2

This kernel is generated from "https://svn-ccsm-models.cgd.ucar.edu/cam1/branches/subcol_SILHS_UWM_v2/" using Intel compiler on NCAR Cheyenne Cluster.

Some of CESM configurations are :

This kernel uses three BLAS functions, which are included in this kernel.

To run the kernel on a single process, go to orig directory and run "make clean run".

To run the kernel on multiple processes using mpi, go to orig directory and run "make clean run MPI=1".
Note that mpi library should be available during compilation and execution.
To change the number of processes, specify it on make command line similar to "make run MPI=1 NPROCS=4"
To use different mpi library than Intel MPI, please modify FC_0 in Makefile.

Program entry of the kernel is inside of "kernel_driver.f90"

"subcol_SILHS.F90" contains a call to kernel code block.

Please contact Youngsung Kim(youngsun@ucar.edu) for any questions concerning this kernel.
