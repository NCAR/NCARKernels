* kernel and supporting files
  - The kernel, taumol03 subroutine, is located at line # 71 of mo_lrtm_gas_optics.f90
  - program statement is in kernel_driver.f90
  - The other files are subset of PSrad source files that only contain information to run the taumol03 subroutine
 
* compilation and execution
  - Place all files in a directory
  - Adjust FC and FFLAGS macros in Makefile to use a particular compiler. Default compiler is gfortran
  - run "make"

* verification
  - "make" command will run kernel and print verification output on screen
  - In general, verification is considered as pass if it shows "IDENTICAL" or "Normalized RMS of difference" is around machine-precision
  - Three data files are provided for verification. The data files are generated from running PSrad which is compiled by Intel 15.0 compiler with "-O3 -xHost" compiler flags

* performance measurement
  - The kernel includes clock measurement that prints elapsed clocks for running the kernel
  - To prevent CPU migration, taskset command is used to run the kernel in Makefile
  - To convert elapsed clocks to elapsed time, please use following formula: elapsed time = elapsed clocks / clock frequency of CPU. For example, in case that elapsed colcks = 7000 and clock frequency of CPU = 2.6 GHz, then elapsed time is around 2.7 ms
