 DSQRT(X) WAS LARGER     0 TIMES             AGREED  2000 TIMES, AND         WAS SMALLER     0 TIMES.
 
 
 THERE ARE  53 BASE   2 SIGNIFICANT DIGITS IN A FLOATING-POINT NUMBER  
 
 
 THE MAXIMUM RELATIVE ERROR OF     0.0000E+00 =    2 **-999.00    OCCURRED FOR X =     0.000000E+00
 
 
 THE ESTIMATED LOSS OF BASE   2 SIGNIFICANT DIGITS IS   0.00
 
 
 THE ROOT MEAN SQUARE RELATIVE ERROR WAS     0.0000E+00 =    2 **-999.00
 
 
 THE ESTIMATED LOSS OF BASE   2 SIGNIFICANT DIGITS IS   0.00
 
 
TEST OF SPECIAL ARGUMENTS
 
 
 DSQRT(XMIN) = DSQRT(  0.2225074-307) =   0.1491668-153
 
 
 DSQRT(1-EPSNEG) = DSQRT(1-  0.1110223E-15) =   0.1000000E+01
 
 
 DSQRT(1.0) = DSQRT(  0.1000000E+01) =   0.1000000E+01
 
 
 DSQRT(1+EPS) = DSQRT(1+  0.2220446E-15) =   0.1000000E+01
 
 
 DSQRT(XMAX) = DSQRT(  0.1797693+309) =   0.1340781+155
 
 
 TEST OF ERROR RETURNS
 
 
 DSQRT WILL BE CALLED WITH THE ARGUMENT     0.0000E+00 THIS SHOULD NOT TRIGGER AN ERROR MESSAGE
 
 
 DSQRT RETURNED THE VALUE     0.0000E+00
 
 
DSQRT WILL BE CALLED WITH THE ARGUMENT    -0.1000E+01 THIS SHOULD TRIGGER AN ERROR MESSAGE
 
 
 DSQRT RETURNED THE VALUE            NaN
