To build the timer library, libtimer.a, you need to do the following steps.

  1) Create a 64 bit floating point function called
     timer_clock() which returns a wall clock time in units of seconds.
     We have already supplied a file called timer_clock.c with SUN, HP, SGI
     support for this function. For accuracy, this timing function should ideally
     provide the benchmarks with timings accurate to system clock tick level
     of granularity.

  2) Create a customized section in the makefile to build the function. We
     have supplied SUN, SGI and HP sections already.
     Things which you will need to customize are the paths for ar, the names 
     and paths of the C and FORTRAN compilers
     and the compiler options.
     
  3) Type bldit ARCH to build for the desired architecture
     This should build the library libtimer.a.

  4) Refer to the file timer.doc for timer interface information.
