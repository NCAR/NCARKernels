CESM2 CLUBB kernel extracted from CESM2

This kernel is generated from cesm2_1_alpha01d using Intel compiler.

To use the kernel, go to orig directory and run "make clean" and "make run".

There are multiple types of input data according to CESM PCOLS value. To use a specific data set,
use make option similar to "make run pcols=<size>". <size> is one of 16 and 192. Default pcols is 16.

The kernel assumes that MPI is installed on system and "mpif90" command is available.
Compiler options are based on Intel compiler that was used for kernel extraction. To compiler the
kernel with other compiler, please change compiler options accordingly.

"_MPI" macro in compiler options enables MPI framework in the kernel.

Program entry of the kernel is inside of "kernel_driver.f90"

"clubb_intr.F90" contains a call to kernel code block.

Please contact Youngsung Kim(youngsun@ucar.edu) for any questions concerning this kernel.
