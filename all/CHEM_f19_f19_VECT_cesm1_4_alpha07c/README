V01: From the devel branch.  This version uses the proper array declarations that allow the compiler to vectorize the code
V02: From the mem_align64 branch.  This version switches the vector length to 64.
v03: From the fullWeakScaling branch.  This version contains the code to re-run the weak scaling test.
v04: From the extrae_work branch.  This version contatins the code to re-run the chem kernel with extrae 
v05: From the real_size_4 branch.  Switches frow double to single precision.  This will be the only version with this modification.
