MG2 kernel


  This kernel represents version 2 of the Morrison-Gettleman micro-physics package that has been extracted from CESM1.3.  
This code represents approximately 10% of the total cost of CAM on Yellowstone.  The MG2 kernel several source files and 
is build using the provide Makefile by typing 'make'. This code can be run on either single threaded or using an entire
shared memory node using OpenMP. The Makefile will need to be modified and the OMP_NUM_THREAD environment variable should 
be set to enable parallel execution.   Note that this kernel has been tested on Intel, Cray, PGI, and GNU compilers.  This 
kernel tests the abilty of the compiler to generate optimize code.  It is likely that code transformations in addition to 
compiler and directive insertion can decrease the execution time for this kernel. 

 
Correctness:

   There are two separate tests for correctness for this kernel, both must be satisfied in order for any modification to be deemed 
acceptable.  The two correctness tests are as follows:

    (1) Each of the outputs from the main computational routine are verified against results calculated based on a baseline run 
	on Yellowstone using the Intel 14.1.3 compiler.  The normalized RMS error for each output variable must be less then 6.0e-11.
        A 'tolerance' value of 6.0e-11 is determined based on the impact that a bit-perturbation has on the initial temperature field.  
        Code exists within the kernel to calculate the normalized RMS error.  A pass of the verification test will generate the 
        following output:

       	     [MG2] KGENPrtCheck: verification PASSED
 
   (2) In addition to passing the verification test described above, the kernel must produce reproducible answers.  Specifically 
       if the kernel is executed 10 times on the same system it must generate the same values for the 'Diagnostic' output line.  Any
       compiler optimization that prevents run-to-run reproducibility due to the use of different code branches based on argument 
       alignment are not acceptible.  

Performance:

   In addition to generating correctness output, the kernel also provides timing runs.  Sample output for both a single thread and 
OpenMP execution is provided below. Note that for the multi-threaded output the 'time per call' is not provided. 

Single-threaded:

 [MG2] [NTHR :=   1] [itmax:= 10000] total time (sec):   10.746
 [MG2] [NTHR :=   1] [itmax:= 10000] time per call (usec):  1074.633

Multi-threaded:
 
 [MG2] [NTHR :=   8] [itmax:= 10000] total time (sec):    1.554
