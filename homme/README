NCAR laplace_sphere_wk Kernel:

  The NCAR kernel laplace_sphere_wk represents an important derivative operator that is used within 
the HOMME dynamical core.  We have created a single thread kernel that executes this operator a user 
selectable number of times.  On KNC hardware we can execute this kernel itmax=1000000 times in approximately 
0.625 seconds.  For the purposes of KNL simulation it is acceptible to reduce itmax to a much smaller value.

We have supplied two different versions of this kernel which are found in the subdirectories: 

	homme_laplace_sphere_wk 
	homme_laplace_sphere_wk2

To build these kernels cd into one of the directories and type 'make build' which builds a single threaded 
executible: kernel_laplace_sphere_wk.exe.  A sample output from a KNC run is seen below.  Note that there is 
both a timing output as well as a correctness check 'laplace is identical'.  Certain optimizations may introduce 
a bit level of change of the output laplace. For example a none bit-for-bit difference is illustrated by the 
following diagnostic output.  

 RMS of difference is   2.330032900491916E-026

Note that because the RMS difference is less then 1.0e-15 this is an acceptible difference. 

I would like to use these two kernels to explore several different questions.  They are:

   (1) Two nearly identical versions of this kernel are provided.  One executes in 0.6255 usec 
	per call while the other in 0.936 usec per call.  I suspect that this is due to an alignment 
        issue.  I would like to understand the reason for the difference in execution rates for these 
	very similar operators and what flags would be necessary to eliminate the performance difference.

    (2) Using the most recent version of the Intel compiler 15.0.0, this kernel will generate incorrect 
	results if the precise floating-point model is used.  I would like to see if this compiler bug 
	is also present in the KNL compiler stack.

    (3) I would like to understand if there are additinoal source code transformations or compiler flags 
        that could improve the performance of these kernels on KNL.


 [kernel_laplace_sphere_wk] total time (sec):   0.625525000000000     
 [kernel_laplace_sphere_wk] time per call (usec):   0.625525000000000     
 laplace is identical.
