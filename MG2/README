* kernel and supporting files
  - The kernel, micro_mg_tend subroutine, is located at line # 242 of micro_mg2_0.F90
  - program statement is in kernel_micro_mg_tend.F90
  - The other files are a subset of CESM source files that only contain information to run the micro_mg_tend subroutine
 
* compilation and execution
  - Place all files in a directory
  - Adjust FC and FFLAGS macros in Makefile to use a particular compiler. Default compiler is ifort
  - run "make"

* verification
  - "make" command will run kernel and print verification output on screen
  - In general, verification is considered as pass if it shows "IDENTICAL" or "Normalized RMS of difference" is around machine-precision
  - One data files are provided for verification. The data files are generated from running PSrad which is compiled by Intel 15.0 compiler with "-O3 -xHost" compiler flags

* performance measurement
  - No performance measurment is provided within kernel.
